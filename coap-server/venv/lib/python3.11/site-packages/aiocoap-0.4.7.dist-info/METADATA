aiocoap -- The Python CoAP library
==================================

The aiocoap package is an implementation of CoAP, the `Constrained Application
Protocol`_.

It is written in Python 3 using its `native asyncio`_ methods to facilitate
concurrent operations while maintaining an easy to use interface.

.. _`Constrained Application Protocol`: http://coap.technology/
.. _`native asyncio`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio

Usage
-----

For how to use the aiocoap library, have a look at the guidedtour_, or at
the examples_ and tools_ provided.

A full reference is available in the  `API documentation`_.

All examples can be run directly from a source code copy. If you prefer to
install it, the usual Python mechanisms apply (see installation_).

.. _`API documentation`: http://aiocoap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html

Features / Standards
--------------------

This library supports the following standards in full or partially:

* RFC7252_ (CoAP): Supported for clients and servers. Multicast is supported on
  the server side, and partially for clients. DTLS is supported but experimental,
  and lacking some security properties. No caching is done inside the library.
* RFC7641_ (Observe): Basic support for clients and servers. Reordering,
  re-registration, and active cancellation are missing.
* RFC7959_ (Blockwise): Supported both for atomic and random access.
* RFC8323_ (TCP, WebSockets): Supports CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets (both
  over HTTP and HTTPS). The TLS parts are server-certificate only;
  preshared, raw public keys and client certificates are not supported yet.
* RFC7967_ (No-Response): Supported.
* RFC8132_ (PATCH/FETCH): Types and codes known, FETCH observation supported.
* RFC9176_: A standalone resource directory
  server is provided along with a library function to register at one. They
  lack support for groups and security considerations, and are generally rather
  simplistic.
* RFC8613_ (OSCORE): Full support client-side; protected servers can be
  implemented based on it but are not automatic yet.
* draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm-17_ (Group OSCORE): Supported for both group
  and pairwise mode in groups that are fully known. (The lack of an implemented
  joining or persistence mechanism makes this impractical for anything but
  experimentation.)

If something described by one of the standards but not implemented, it is
considered a bug; please file at the `github issue tracker`_. (If it's not on
the list or in the excluded items, file a wishlist item at the same location).

Dependencies
------------

Basic aiocoap works out of the box on Python_ 3.7 or newer (also works on
PyPy3_). For full support (DTLS, OSCORE and link-format handling) follow the
installation_ instructions as these require additional libraries.

aiocoap provides different network backends for different platforms. The most
featureful backend is available for Linux, but most operations work on BSDs,
Windows and macOS as well. See the FAQ_ for more details.

If your library depends on aiocoap, it should pick the required extras (as per
installation_) and declare a dependency like ``aiocoap[linkheader,oscore] >= 0.4b2``.

.. _PyPy3: http://pypy.org/
.. _FAQ: http://aiocoap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html

Development
-----------

aiocoap tries to stay close to PEP8_ recommendations and general best practice,
and should thus be easy to contribute to.

Bugs (ranging from "design goal" and "wishlist" to typos) are currently tracked
in the `github issue tracker`_. Pull requests are welcome there; if you start
working on larger changes, please coordinate on the issue tracker.

Documentation is built using sphinx_ with ``./setup.py build_sphinx``; hacks
used there are described in ``./doc/README.doc``.

Unit tests are implemented in the ``./tests/`` directory and easiest run using
tox_ (though still available through ``./setup.py test`` for the time being);
complete test coverage is aimed for, but not yet complete (and might never be,
as the error handling for pathological network partners is hard to trigger with
a library designed not to misbehave). The tests are regularly run at the `CI
suite at gitlab`_, from where `coverage reports`_ are available.
